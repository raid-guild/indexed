## Type

DPOS based L2 solution with ability to issue custom coins and exchange them for BTC, ETH or other issued coins.

## Tx Cost

1 BIP for simple "Send" transaction (~1500 gwei as of 2021/01/14).  
24h average transaction fee (as of 2021/01/14) -> 9.89 BIP.

## Finality

5 seconds on average. Actual speed may vary depending on count of validators, their computational power, internet speed, etc.

## Consensus

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus protocol. The blockchain utilizes Tendermint Consensus Engine, which relies on a set of validators that are responsible for committing new blocks into the blockchain. Validators are determined by who has the most stake delegated to them and their number is limited.

## $ Efficient

DPOS protocol implies low energy requirements – lower than POW or POS (see [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8798621)). Low-end to mid-range HW is recommended to run validator's node. 
45 validators provide enough resources for at least 1000TPS (as of January 2021).

## Max TPS

~1000 now, 5000-10000 at the end of 2021.
