## Type

L2 scaling solution based on Plasma.

## Tx Cost

Fee for transfering ETH to/from OMG Network is equal to ETH transfer fees (average gas price 87 gwei as of 2021/01/14).  
Fee for one transaction on OMG Network is [~0.0716 OMG](https://blockexplorer.mainnet.v1.omg.network/fees) (0.23 USD as of 2021/01/14).

## Finality

Transaction speed is much faster than on Layer 1 but the finality block time is parallel with Layer 1 -> ~15 seconds.

## Consensus

Proof-of-Authority as of 2021/01/14. Proof-of-Stake will replace PoA once it's implemented.

## $ Efficient

YES.  
Plasma (either using PoA or PoS) ensures high throughput and very low cost per transaction. These properties imply high capital efficiency.

## Max TPS

In the last successful test (June 2020) the network was processing around 4000 TPS.
