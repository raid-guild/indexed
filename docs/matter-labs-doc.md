### Types

ZKSNARK

### Tx Cost

$0.001 (off-chain), 1.9k gas (on-chain) (https://zksync.io/faq/tokens.html#fee-costs)

### Finality

10 minutes. (https://zksync.io/faq/tech.html#transaction-finality)

### Consensus

Validity proofs (https://zksync.io/faq/security.html#validity-proofs)

### $ Efficient

Yes (withdrawals to L1 in under 15 min). (https://zksync.io/faq/intro.html#zksync-features)

### Max TPS

2000 TPS

Currently, 300+ TPS due to the current limitations of the PLONK CRS (zkSync node infrastructure has been benchmarked to support >8000 TPS).

### Additional Info:

- security: secure as L1

- generality: support smart contracts (written in Zinc), and existing Solidity code can easily be translated into Zinc (but Zinc is currently non-Turing-complete as Solidity. Its means: recursion and unbounded loops are prohibited)

- composability: support composability (All contracts inside zkSync L2 network will be able to call each other atomically in exactly the same way as on Ethereum mainnet).

- permissionless innovation: The token is currently added manually, but in the future it is possible to deploy the token. (https://zksync.io/faq/tokens.html#supported-tokens)
