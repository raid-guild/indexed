### Name

Minter

### Description

L2 solution based on Delegated Proof-of-Stake with ability to issue custom coins and exchange them for BTC, ETH or other issued coins.

$0.01 for simple "Send" transaction.  
$0.03 for "Swap"

One can pay fee in any coin, fee price is bonded to the stable coin like USDT and converts to BIP in a moment of processing transaction.

Fees for other transactions: https://www.minter.network/docs#fee

### Finality

5 seconds on average. Actual speed may vary depending on count of validators, their computational power, internet speed, etc.

### Consensus

Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus protocol. The blockchain utilizes Tendermint Consensus Engine, which relies on a set of validators that are responsible for committing new blocks into the blockchain. Validators are determined by who has the most stake delegated to them and their number is limited.

### Capital Efficient

YES.  
DPoS protocol implies low energy requirements â€“ lower than PoW or PoS (see [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8798621)). Low-end to mid-range HW is recommended to run validator's node. 45 validators provide enough resources for at least 1000TPS (as of January 2021).

### Max TPS

~1000 now, 5000-10000 at the end of 2021.
